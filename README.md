This is my version of the "**OOP Game Show App**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree**.

In this project, I had to create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

Starter files in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.
