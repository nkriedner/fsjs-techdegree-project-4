This is my version of the "**OOP Game Show App**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree**.

In this project, I had to create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

Starter files in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.

For the "Exceeds Expectation" grade I have made some style changes:

-   I changed the background-colors for every phase of the game to different linear-gradients
-   I changed the font-family of the "Phrase Hunter" heading to "Dancing Script"
-   I gave the keyboard letters a different background and scaled them on hover
-   I changed the background-color of the .shown letters to a dark green
-   I changed the background-color of the selected keyboard letters (green for correct / red for wrong)
